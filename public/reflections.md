## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.
 1. Variable Declaration - Variable declaration is a very basic topic that is learned in many other programming langauges. It is one of the most fundamental units in programming, and can be declared or assigned.

 2. Arithmetic Operators - There are multiple operators in JavaScript that are used to manipulate and convert data. For example--math is fundamental when it comes to programming, and arithmetic operators are what allow us to perform arithmetic when coding. 

 3. If Statements - If statements are conditional statements. They allow us to enter a condition, and the result can either be true or false. If the statement is true, the action inside the statement will be performed. Otherwise, if it is false, a different action can be performed if there is an else statement.

 4. For Loops - There are many kinds of loop control structures in JavaScript. One of the loops we discussed was for loops, which allows us to declare variables then run them through a boolean expression. 

 5. I/O Statements - These are statements we discussed in class that allow the user to input a value, then an output will be generated. There are multiple statements that can be used depending on the purpose.


## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
 I believe that I need practice on all the topics in CS3. I am familiar with all the topics, however, I have a habit of forgetting things easily. I believe that my mastery on all the topics needs to be improved.


## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
 There are times where I am unable to study for assessments due to the large amount of requirements we have in other subjects. I plan to manage my time better and allot more time for studying and practicing programming in JavaScript and HTML.


## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
 In my opinion, bonus activities and graded exercises were effective, especially bonus activities. They challenged us to practice programming for a grade. For bonus activities, we were also under time pressure, but not as extreme as that of an exam's time pressure. I believe that there weren't any ineffective activities that did not help me understand the topics. I believe that all of them were effective in some way.
